            <div class="content">
                <p><img src="../images/PortraitMamaEdit.PNG" alt="a picture of my honey" align="left"> RoxAnn McCool was born in the small town of Sidney, Nebraska on December 5, 1974. She was born to David and Sharon Smelley and has four older siblings. She also has six nieces and nephews that she showers with love and praise and spoils with gifts. She has taken care of her mother since she was thirteen when her father passed. Her mother and her are like sisters and the best of friends. She is deeply appreciated by her family and cares for her community the same way she cares for her family and friends. 
                <p>RoxAnn is a craftsman, and is always making something, either for a person, an event, or a season. She uses a Cricut machine for printing and cutting the designs she makes online, and enlists her husband or brothers to cut lumber for her when she is onto something big. She also is not afraid to pick up a can of spray paint and make it the way she wants. Her favorite colors are purple and Husker Red. She takes tons of photos at sporting events and family gatherings which she then uses in her craft making.</p> 
                <p>RoxAnn is a Husker fan, through and through. If she is not yelling at the football team or coach Frost, you might find her in the stands of a Lady Huskers Volleyball game with her sister and niece. She has a wide knowledge of the statistics, championships, players and coaches of her teams. Since she has been married, she has become a Major League Baseball fan and enjoys watching the Los Angeles Dodgers play the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field.</p>
                <p>RoxAnn is also involved in her community. She loves to attend events for people or causes and is always willing to give to others. She especially loves friendly auctions and blind auctions when she knows the money is being used to support someone or something she believes in. She supports the Night of Hope for cancer survivors, as her father and mother-in-law both passed from cancer. She likes to walk for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and is very saddened when we lose a young person to suicide. She also supports Sidney Red Raider high school sports and the American Legion’s minor league baseball team in Sidney.</p>
                <p>RoxAnn is truly an independent, self-sufficient, homegrown Nebraska woman who has an endless well of love for her family, friends, veterans, and community. She is truly a Sidney icon.</p>
